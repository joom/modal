# modal

I am attempting at an Agda implementation of the MinML5 language described in the paper
["Modal Types for Mobile Code"](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tom7/papers/modal-types-for-mobile-code.pdf),
with a few changes to the language.

After the compilation of MinML5 to JavaScript, I will try to prove the correctness of the compiler.
